What it aims ?
</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
As we all know we live in a society, sorry for sarcasm but yes as we all face issues in our day to day lives, we have complaints sometimes regarding any service or security, we find our neighbors troubling or we think something can be changed for good.
</li>
<li>
These points, on a smaller scale are notes as society or locality issues, on a bit larger level, its ward/zone issues, on little more larger its municipal and then district/city issues.
</li>
<li>
Although systems exist to resolve issues that arise on each of these levels but we know how much they really help, and how easily accessible they are.
So a Dapp that gives everyone an interface to raise complaints, track them and hold respective authority accountable for issues happened due to negligence, all in front of public on blockchain, which cannot be ignored for long.

<h2>
What about implementation ?
</h2>
</div>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
To ensure that the true issues are considered and no one allegates for getting false public attention,
we will have complaints only from users who have registered profiles, which includes their identity data like,
Aadhar card, Driving License, Address and are allowed to raise complaint on being verified, we can even ensure the eKYC is done to complaint on levels above locality.
<br>
Although we'll have way to trace anyone logding complaint, it'll only be accessed when the person tries to use the Dapp in unethical way against our terms & conditions.
